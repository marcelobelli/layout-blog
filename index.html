                <p>Seen nearer, the Thing was incredibly strange, for it was no mere insensate machine driving on its way. Machine it was, with a ringing metallic pace, and long, flexible, glittering tentacles (one of which gripped a young pine tree) swinging
                    and rattling about its strange body.</p>
                <p>It picked its road as it went striding along, and the brazen hood that surmounted it moved to and fro with the inevitable suggestion of a head looking about. Behind the main body was a huge mass of white metal like a gigantic fisherman’s basket,
                    and puffs of green smoke squirted out from the joints of the limbs as the monster swept by me. And in an instant it was gone.</p>
                <p>So much I saw then, all vaguely for the flickering of the lightning, in blinding highlights and dense black shadows.</p>
                <p>As it passed it set up an exultant deafening howl that drowned the thunder—“Aloo! Aloo!”—and in another minute it was with its companion, half a mile away, stooping over something in the field. I have no doubt this Thing in the field was the
                    third of the ten cylinders they had fired at us from Mars.</p>
